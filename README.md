# Neural_Network_from_Scratch
Neural Network from Scratch without Keras or Tensorflow

Programming a neural network from Scratch, it's very useful to learn how works a neural network and how calculate the parameters. We have used sklearn to generate
a random dataset and we have built functions to train a neural network.
