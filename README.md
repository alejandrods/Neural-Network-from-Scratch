# Neural Network from Scratch

It is globally known that several people consider that Neural Networks are “a black box” and we do not know what it is inside and how they work. However, I do not agree with this statement and I consider that to comprehend how they learn some tasks is an important part of a good data scientist. 

I tried to recreate this [neural network playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.41885&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false), a tool that provides a better understanding of Neural Networks. In this project, I built a neural network from scratch, without using any framework (Keras, Tensorflow, ...) just our own functions. It is very useful for understanding the concepts and basic parameters of the neural network.
