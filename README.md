It is globally known that several people consider that Neural Networks are “a black box” and we do not know what it is inside and how they work. However, I do not agree with this statement and I consider that to comprehend how they learn some tasks is an important part of a good data scientist.

I tried to recreate this [nice tool](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.41885&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false) by myself because It would help me to understand how Neural Networks work and learn to find the best parameters. We do not use Keras or Tensorflow or any framework to build and train our network, the network is built from scratch using our functions. It is very useful for understanding the concepts and basic parameters of the neural network. We have used sklearn to generate a random dataset and we have just built functions to train it.
